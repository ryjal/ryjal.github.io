				<p>Before I start I know this is probably not in the right order, but let’s be real we both probably can’t remember what order these pictures are supposed to be in anyway so its okay…</p>

				<p>Also I apologize if this website is slightly dank, this was as much as I could muster up since I was trying to figure out what I wanted for the title and all that. Plus it’s meant to be improved upon as well – you said you wanted to make a travel blog and I want to do cool things with this website (aka take it off static site and do cool things with it) for us – so it’s perfect for whatever we want to do :D.</p>

				<p>But anyway, you mentioned that you couldn’t remember the little things about us and the things that we’ve done, so I hope that this small collection of pictures will help you recall the wonderful memories we’ve made and the experiences that we’ve been through together.</p>

				<p>It all started junior year; we met through spending time with Hieu and Sachin at the couple benches by the tennis courts. We barely interacted before, even after volleyball sophomore year. Through threatening me with peaches and playing volleyball on the sand courts and getting sunburnt, however, we seemed to get closer (also because I’m a beast and protected your white peaches) - Close enough to start Snapchatting each other shortly afterwards.</p>

				<p>And through Snapchat (and the unreasonable number of retakes that we went through before sending each other a picture) we got to know each other and discovered that we had the same interests. We loved to speculate about the world around us, get excited over talk about space and super advanced technology, make fun of each other over our volleyball skills, gossip about other people on campus, and watch anime. This connection only grew over the semester, and soon we were comfortable enough as friends (kek friendzoned) to share more personal aspects of our life with each other.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/facepaint.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>And so came the 03-07 Halloween Party (and I believe you dragged me into going). But we had an amazing time together, face painting and chatting about random things that came to mind. The face paint that I drew on you also turned out to be far better than yours, and our night drew to a close after I robbed as much candy as I could carry.</p>

				<p>The party caused our friendship to deepen, and watching Harsh play Gun Bros on Miniclip, killing ourselves over Amy Xie’s useless comments in World in the 20th, taking “cute” pictures of me at the junior couches, calling me at 2am and ranting about how our pathway “makes no sense”, and guilt tripping you into completing your part of the GBM project only expanded upon the trust and the understanding we established.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/Convocation.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Our efforts didn’t go to waste; although there was a difficult period between us, the connection that we fostered kept us close, and we helped each other through the hardships that we faced. We picked up right where we left off over the summer, and it was like we were never separated at all. We came back to IMSA, this time with both of us being wing guides and on SCS. It turned out that the two commitments conflicting worked out for us, and we both became closer through dying over wing decorations and preparing for move in (I still don't know how you used the entire roll of that film paper that I gave you - you used it a little excessively don't you think). And soon the start of senior year was upon us with convocation. You eagerly wanted to take a picture together with your beautiful dress, and I ended up sitting a row behind you. “Titans fly together”, and as I dropped our first assembly boat on your lap, our journey through the skies was about to begin.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/benches.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Soon after our experiences with move-in and convocation, we began to focus on us. We recognized our compatibility, and the experiences that we’ve already shared through junior year only strengthened our feelings for each other. Coupled with the unrealistic amount of time we spent with each other, it was inevitable that you felt bubbly after I walked you back to 03 and we came to terms with our true emotions. And soon we were inseparable; we spent as much time as we could with each other, talking, cuddling, and enjoying each other’s company. It seemed as if we were making up for the time that we lost through our first two years at IMSA, except we both were on the same page and loving every second that was spent together and refusing to be separated.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">

				</div>

				<p>Before we knew it, homecoming season arrived, and we showed no signs of slowing down. We continued to do everything together, including demonstrating who the best dancers on campus were after countless hours of practicing Andrew and Dhara’s choreography along with our stunts. There were some signs of disapproval, which was clearly evident when you saw I decided to go shirtless during the pep rally (But I’m pretty sure you enjoyed it to a certain degree, so I have no regrets).</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/hc.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Shortly after, our time together continued, and I pulled an all-nighter to create the EXO poster to ask you to homecoming. Unfortunately, I didn’t surprise you too much with the ask the next day (Jenny and Shannon made it too obvious, forcefully dragging you back into the room and distracting you too conspicuously (don’t tell them I said that)), but I was still nervous as I stood in the quad holding the D.O. poster along with the poster board. After taking pictures together, we spent the interviz talking, ending the night with a walk under the night sky and conversation.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/hcfountain.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Homecoming night came with us deciding not to attend the dance, but we were determined to go to Lou Malnati’s with Gina, Michelle, Tim, and Daniel. You were also determined to have me try the restaurant for the first time, and we sat together devouring the deep dish pizzas. We then headed towards the bridge after paying for the food and deciding to give you the remainder of the pizza.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/hcdank.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>The chilly night continued and we hogged the camera, taking picture after picture on the bridge and around the area. It was inevitable that we had the most pictures out of the group since the other two couples were too shy and embarrassed to take photos together. The night drew on, and we even visited an ice cream shop before being picked up by my parents to cheer you up since the tea shop was closed. After getting back on campus we changed and headed straight for the hill. We slow danced to Ed Sheeran and talked the night away, and the thought of being caught by security disappeared into the back of our minds as we shared a butterfly kiss in the dark. It was here that our relationship grew stronger, and we soared even higher as we stole a kiss in your room the next evening.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/twinning.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>And we grew more comfortable after those nights, spending more and more time together while learning a bunch more about each other. We continued to be inseparable, and you finally caved to my amazing sweater, culminating in us twinning one day and eventually to me giving you my sweater for a majority of the year. But this was only the beginning.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/faceswap.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>As we grew more accustomed to each other we also uncovered more about our shared sense of humor, among other things. The weather grew colder, and we transitioned to spending time inside and wreaking havoc in the halls. We shared laughs and “wasted” time on the couches, and we experienced just about everything, from messing with Aidan to devouring animal crackers and doing college apps/watching anime.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/imsa07-1.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>So our story continued. Even though we couldn’t take long walks around campus and hide under the cover of the trees in the winter, we still spent as much time as we could around each other. Time would be spent doing homework in the study rooms, stressing out about simulations and other programs, and goofing around after coming back from shopping trips where you bought chap stick and chips among other things.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>But this time of bliss didn’t last forever, and you dragged me into choreographing for lunar. Our efforts were then spent in the Student Union figuring out which songs we wanted to use for each section of the Senior Dance. We would dance together for hours, even to songs that would get stolen by modern. Time was also spent struggling to teach the songs that we learned to the rest of the seniors along with thinking of formations and scheduling times and places to meet throughout the main building. Still, we made it through, and we created more memories through lunar and through couples’ dance, along with you emasculating me in order to look better for B-friends.</p>

				<p>Sadly, even after lunar our time was limited as I began volleyball season. Still though, we sought to be together as often as possible, and you would come judge me at home games for being an incompetent libero. We would then quickly return to the couches after volleyball, and you would suffer through my odorous body while we ate strawberries and watched anime.</p>

					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/intervis.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Our time together continued this way, and where we missed out on spending time with each other on weekdays we made up for on the weekends. We sacrificed countless hours of sleep each weekend to wake up at an ungodly hour and eat brunch, followed by attempts to convince Barbara and Kevin to give us an intervis. Time would fly as we intervised and spent the entire day with each other in our rooms, with one exception where we got caught on an intervis (smh). Our begging didn’t always work on the RCs, but we always found another way to enjoy each other’s company, whether through peeling pomelos or counting cards together on the couches or in the study rooms.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/housevisit.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>We then grew close enough to the point that we decided I should visit your house over an extended weekend. Time was then spent cuddling late into the night and watching Kimi no Nawa and other movies at weird hours to avoid being sent to bed. We went all over the town too, eating Pho, watching Jboy play hockey, going shopping at Ross and arguing over getting new shoes, and buying the maroon pants and blue sweater outfit at Banana Republic along with messing around at your house.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/iceskateing.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>We even went ice skating together at the ice rink where your brothers would play hockey. We enjoyed ourselves for an hour after being dropped off by a stressed Mr. Lee when he found out that we napped together. I never wanted to leave your house, but our fun ended and we had to return to IMSA.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/Clash1.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Soon after my visit, the clash season started, and we quickly became busy from our classwork, clash preparations, and me with more volleyball. Still, we managed to find time to spend together, and we gossiped throughout the day about hall movies, decorations, and getting robbed in our respective events. Clash pep rally soon arrived, and we watched as each hall performed and the end results with 03 placing high and 07 being dethroned. The gym flooded with students, but we managed to find each other and went for a walk outside after taking pictures.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/bowtie.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Shortly after clash season, the rush for prom began for us. You didn’t know too much about my plan for the ask, but I gathered Once together to practice Knock Knock in anticipation for the day at the 05 slabs. The only problem was deciding a legitimate song to ask you with. Luckily, we had been choreographing together to Weight in Gold, and you had showed me a song by the same artist before. The days went by as I pieced together choreography and coerced Once to practice even though they all refused to cooperate (seriously it was the most difficult thing in the world, they straight up didn’t want to practice). And, much like homecoming, I pulled an all nighter to complete the poster for the prom ask. The fateful day arrived, and you discovered that I had put together all the things that you told me not to do, but my choreography was good enough that you let it slide.

				And prom preparations continued. We moved back outside to walks around the campus with occasional days spent cuddling on the couches, and you argued for me to wear a bowtie to prom instead of a tie. I agreed and we scrambled to find a bowtie, only to have your mom buy one and my brother lend me his bowtie. And as it turns out, you’re a legend at tying bowties.</p>

				<div class = "memory-image">
					<div class = "row">
						<div class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
							<img src = "./images/prom.jpg">
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Prom day arrived, and it was our best night together. Time flew by as we prepared to leave in the morning, putting on makeup, putting on suits and dresses, worrying about whether my suit jacket matched my pants (which sadly they didn’t), and taking pictures on campus at the slabs. Your mom arrived in time to deliver the boutonniere and corsage and continued to take pictures wherever she could. Soon, we were on our way to Shedd.</p>

				<p>The day was beautiful, and we jumped at every opportunity to take pictures over the lake, forcing George to handle the camera while Claudia fangirled. We looked at all the indoor exhibits after an eventful dinner with cheesecake, salad, mashed potatoes, and chicken, holding hands and talking idly. Eventually, we made our way back to the dance floor, where we were surprised to be celebrated for prom court.</p>

				<p>The night got even better as we went to Main Event, stealing kisses on the bus as we drove down to Naperville. When we arrived we immediately changed and started our rampage through the arcade. There we were playing laser tag, pool, and all the games we could find. We also decided to get as many tickets as we could, playing games like Flappy Birds, the monkey tail grabbing game, and other arcade games like Asteroid (the weird alien shooting arcade game that we played). Unfortunately, the night had to end, and we napped together on the bus as we returned back to IMSA. Soon after, we spent as much time as we could together and had more fun with Andriy’s photo shoot before the year came to a close.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>And now here we are. Even though distance separates us and we might not be able to spend physical time together like we used to, our experiences and the things that we’ve been through together are unique to us. We know each other the best because of the bond between us, and we’re here for each other in times of need. Life will continue and things will inevitably change, but I know that you’ll do amazing things. And I will be right there with you as we aim for the stars and accomplish our goals. After all, Titans fly together.</p>
